 * WO#1142 D4 — pin which surfaces use the opaque error envelope, and which

 * WO#1137 fixed nine raw-error leaks and deliberately left connector.ts's
 * fifteen alone. That judgment currently lives in a commit message and a
 * comment; this makes it fail loudly instead of quietly rotting.
 *
 * If a test here fails, do not "fix" the code until you have read the reason.
