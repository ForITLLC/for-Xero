# Runbook — Connector API key issuance & rotation

**Scope:** the `x-api-key` credential that machine callers (the ForIT MCP gateway,
Power Automate, scripts) present to `https://xero.forit.io/api/connector/*`.

## Where the accepted key actually lives — read this first

There is **no app setting and no Key Vault secret that the connector compares against**
for `/api/connector/*`. Every ARM-side hunt for "the connector's API key" is a dead end,
and that dead end is what turned WO#1821 into an outage investigation.

`connector/src/functions/connector.ts` → `authenticateRequest()` → `validateApiKey()`
(`connector/src/services/database.ts:226`) does exactly this:

```
sha256(presented key)  ->  SELECT ... FROM xero.api_keys ak
                           JOIN xero.customers c ON c.id = ak.customer_id
                           WHERE ak.key_hash = @hash AND ak.is_active = 1
```

So the **authority is the `xero.api_keys` table** in `forit-saas-sql.database.windows.net` /
database `forit`. Only the *hash* is stored; the plaintext exists exactly once, at issuance.
Losing it means minting a new one — it cannot be recovered.

Do not confuse these three, all of which have been mistaken for "the connector key":

| Secret | Vault | What it actually guards |
|---|---|---|
| `PORTAL-API-KEY` | `forit-xero-mcp-kv` | `/api/connect/*` only (portal→connector). Compared as a string in `connect.ts:50`. **Not** `/api/connector/*`. |
| `MCP-API-KEY` | `forit-xero-mcp-kv` | Legacy. Not referenced by any live code path. |
| `XERO-CONNECTOR-PORTAL-KEY` | `forit-saas-kv` | Legacy `fmcp_` key, no longer an active row. Dead. |

## Reading the 401 — the two bodies mean opposite things

`/api/connector/*` returns 401 for three distinct reasons. **Always read the body before acting:**

| Body | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `{"error":"Missing API key"}` | Caller sent no `x-api-key` header at all | Wire the caller's secret. **Do not rotate anything.** |
| `{"error":"Invalid API key"}` | Header sent; no active row matches the hash | Mint a new key (below) |
| `{"error":"Xero connection expired"}` | Key is fine; the *Xero* refresh token is dead | Re-consent at https://forit.io/portal. **A new API key fixes nothing.** |

A 404 means no Xero connection row — not a key problem. A **403 now has two
causes**, and the body tells them apart:

| Body | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `{"error":"No active subscription"}` | Key is valid; the customer has no active `xero-connector` grant | Grant the product in `xero.customer_products` |
| `{"error":"Read-only API key"}` | Key is valid and entitled, but scoped `read` and the caller attempted a write | Working as intended. Do **not** widen the key to silence it — see below. |

## Issuing a key

### Approved gateway read key (decision 18b3e8e7)

The manual **Issue approved Xero read key** workflow on `main` invokes
`POST /api/ops/keys/for-mcp` with the full `decision_id`. The Functions host
requires its master administration key, which stays inside the deployment runner.
Customer keys, portal keys, scope overrides and customer overrides are refused.

Issuance uses the Xero app's own `ManagedIdentityCredential` for both SQL and
Key Vault. It does not use the legacy password pool. Before invoking it, provision
the app identity into its own scoped Entra runtime group, mapped as SQL `TYPE=X`.
Required rights in database `forit`: `CONNECT`, `SELECT` on `xero.customers`,
`xero.products`, `xero.customer_products`, `xero.xero_connections` and
`xero.api_keys`, and `INSERT` on `xero.api_keys`. The transaction uses
`sys.sp_getapplock` to serialize issuance. The app also needs get/set rights on
only `forit-saas-kv/xero-api-key-for-mcp`. Do not use an administrator password,
an agent database login or the old password-backed provisioning path.

The route is pinned to this approval, ForIT's verified customer and scope `read`.
It saves the value once to the approved vault, then inserts the SHA-256 hash.
The mandatory SQL `key_prefix` column contains the fixed label `fmcp_read`,
without any credential bytes. A repeated call reconciles the existing vault
version and row under the transaction lock; it never rotates or reactivates a
key. A saved vault version survives a failed SQL insert and is reused on retry.
Conflicting vault metadata, rows, disabled keys or missing entitlement fail closed.
The response and workflow artifact contain IDs and version metadata only.

After issuance, for-mcp binds the named secret and reloads. Prove
`GET /api/connector/Organisation` returns 200 and
`POST /api/connector/contacts` with `{}` returns 403 with error exactly
`Read-only API key`. The empty contact has no Name, so it cannot create a contact
even if the scope gate fails. Notify Finance and record the decision execution
receipt only after those effects are verified.

`POST /api/keys/new` is **disabled** (410 Gone — `mcpAuth.ts:128`); public signup moved to
the portal. So there are two sanctioned paths:

1. **Portal (preferred, human):** https://forit.io/portal — issues against the signed-in customer.
2. **Direct insert (automation/break-glass):** use the same shape as
   `createApiKey()` (`database.ts:208`) so the row matches what the validator expects:

   - `key = 'fmcp_' + base64url(randomBytes(32))`  → 48 chars total
   - `key_prefix = key.substring(0, 12)`
   - `key_hash = sha256(key)` (hex)
   - `INSERT INTO xero.api_keys (customer_id, key_hash, key_prefix, name, scope) VALUES (...)`
     — omit `scope` and the column defaults to `'full'`. Pass `'read'` deliberately.

   Legacy 37-char `fmcp_` keys predate the current generator. Length is not validated —
   only the hash is — but mint new keys at the current 48-char shape.

   The customer must also hold an active/trial `xero-connector` grant in
   `xero.customer_products`, or every call returns 403 (`checkProductAccess`, `database.ts:385`).

## Key scope — `full` vs `read` (WO#1821B)

`xero.api_keys.scope` (added by `connector/sql/007-add-api-key-scope.sql`) decides what a
key may do. Two values, CHECK-constrained:

| Scope | What it can do |
|---|---|
| `full` (default) | Everything the connector exposes. What every key issued before WO#1821B has. |
| `read` | `GET` only, on every route — **and no Xero tokens at all** (see below). |

**Where it is enforced.** `authenticateRequest()` (`connector.ts`) refuses a `read` key on
any non-`GET`, before the subscription check, the connection lookup and the token refresh —
so a refused request touches no Xero state. The check is on the HTTP method in the one place
every route funnels through, *not* a per-route allow-list. That is deliberate: the catch-all
`connector/{*path}` proxies whatever method it is handed straight to Xero, so a list that
named the six write routes and missed the catch-all would enforce nothing, and a route added
next month would be unprotected by default.

**`GET /api/tokens` is refused for a `read` key regardless of method.** It is a GET, so a
pure method gate would wave it through — but what it returns is a Xero *access and refresh
token*, a full write credential the holder can use against Xero directly, outside this
connector and outside every gate in it. Handing one to a read-only key makes the scope
cosmetic. `mcpAuth.ts` blocks it separately for exactly that reason.

**Anything that is not exactly `read` resolves to `full`.** A missing, null or misspelled
scope keeps today's access rather than silently losing it mid-request, and `validateApiKey`
probes for the column with `COL_LENGTH` so the code is safe against a database that has not
run `sql/007` yet. The CHECK constraint is what stops a typo becoming a quiet privilege
grant on a newly issued key — do not drop it.

**Choosing a scope at issuance.** Default to `read` for any consumer that only needs to
look at Xero data; that is most of them. Issue `full` only when the consumer has a named,
approved write it must perform. Widening an existing key is a decision, not a fix: if a
`read` key starts returning `{"error":"Read-only API key"}`, find out what write the caller
started attempting before changing the row.

Pinned by `connector/test/apiKeyScope.test.js`, which asserts (among other things) that the
rejection happens *before* any upstream fetch.

### Applying the migration, and checking whether it is applied

**Migrations run in the pipeline, never from a chat session or a laptop.** Dispatch the
**Apply SQL Migration** workflow (`.github/workflows/apply-migration.yml`) **from `main`**
with `migration = 007-add-api-key-scope.sql`. It runs the file against
`forit-saas-sql` / database `forit` using the same service principal `connector.yml`
deploys with, reads the schema back, and confirms the app agrees. Set `scope_gate_smoke`
to prove the gate live: it mints a throwaway `scope='read'` key inside the runner, POSTs
with it, asserts a 403 whose body is `Read-only API key`, and revokes the key in a
`finally` block. The plaintext never leaves that step.

Note the database is **`forit`**, not `forit-saas-db` — see
`connector/src/services/database.ts:81`, which is the authority:
`database: process.env.SAAS_DB_NAME || 'forit'`.

`forit-saas-db` is a persistent and expensive misnomer. It is what the server is
*named after*, and it appears in older `connector/sql/` headers and in this repo's
`CLAUDE.md` — which is **gitignored**, so each machine carries its own copy and a
correction on one does not reach the others. Assume any given session is working
from the wrong name and check `database.ts` before connecting. WO#1821B lost
close to an hour to it: a migration was routed at the wrong database, which
surfaced as a login failure rather than as a "no such database" error.

**To check whether the gate is armed, ask the app:**

```bash
curl -s https://xero.forit.io/api/health | jq '.checks.api_key_scope_gate'
```

`ready: true` means the column exists and a `scope='read'` key is enforced. `ready: false`
with `reason: "scope_column_absent"` means the migration has not run, **every key resolves
to `full`, and the gate is inert** — the code being deployed proves nothing on its own.
That distinction is invisible from anywhere else, which is why health reports it.

An unarmed gate deliberately does **not** turn health 503. An unapplied migration is not a
fault, and should not page anyone.

## Handing a key to a consumer — the rule

**The plaintext key is written to Key Vault once, at issuance, and never travels any other way.**
Not in a chat message, a commit, a log line, a tmux pane, an ARM app setting, or a work-order report.
The consuming service references it **by secret name**:

- Naming convention (matches `finance-api-key-for-mcp`, `sms-api-key-for-mcp`):
  **`xero-api-key-for-mcp`** in `forit-saas-kv`.
- The MCP gateway (Azure Container Apps) binds it as a `secretRef` → env var.
  A plain-text app setting or a baked-in env value is a defect, not a shortcut.
- The handoff to the consuming session is **the secret name only**.

## Rotation

1. Mint the new key (above) as a **second active row** for the same customer.
2. Write the plaintext to the consumer's Key Vault secret (new version).
3. Restart / re-resolve the consumer so it picks up the new version.
4. Verify: `GET /api/connector/Organisation` returns 200 for the consumer.
5. Only then set the old row `is_active = 0`. Keep the row — `last_used_at` is the
   audit trail that proves nothing else was still using it.

Overlap before revoke. Revoking first is what produces a silent outage that nobody
notices until an unrelated health probe is added weeks later.

## Monitoring — why this outage went unseen for 26 days

`/api/connector/Organisation` last returned 200 on **2026-08-06 16:40:45Z** and 401'd on
every request afterwards. Nothing detected it until the gateway's upstream-health probe
(WO#1816) started calling that path on **2026-09-01 23:52Z**. The probe did not break
anything — it was the first thing that ever looked.

Per-caller success is the signal that matters; total request volume is not, because the
Power Automate lane stayed green throughout and kept the aggregate healthy.

Useful query (App Insights `forit-xero-mcp`, appId `3b48298d-5557-42c6-a226-3e9ea82d2e96`):

```kusto
requests
| where timestamp > ago(30d)
| where url contains "/api/connector"
| extend p = tostring(split(url, "/api/connector/")[1])
| summarize n = count(), lastSeen = max(timestamp) by p, resultCode
| order by lastSeen desc
```

## Xero OAuth scopes — what the code requests vs what the token carries (WO#2073)

The scope list is `connector/src/services/xeroScopes.ts`: one constant, used at
consent (`POST /api/connect/init`) and at refresh (`xeroConnection.ts`), pinned by
`connector/test/xeroOAuthScopes.test.js`. Changing it changes **nothing** for an
existing connection: Xero mints the token's `scope` claim at consent, and every
refresh keeps that claim. So the two questions have two different answers:

| Question | Where the answer is |
|---|---|
| What will the **next** consent request? | `xeroScopes.ts` at the deployed commit (`GET /api/health` → `commit`) |
| What does the **current** token carry? | Dispatch **Read Xero Token Scope** (`.github/workflows/read-xero-token-scope.yml`). It prints the JWT `scope` claim per connection with the customer email and tenant; the access token is masked and the refresh token is never selected. |
| Will Xero accept a scope string for this app? | `GET https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=…&redirect_uri=…&scope=…&state=x` — a `302` to `/identity/user/login` means accepted, a `302` to `/identity/error` means rejected. No consent happens; it is safe to run from anywhere. |

After a scope change ships, each connected customer must re-consent. Two ways:

1. **Portal (durable):** `https://www.forit.io/portal/xero-connector` → Connect. The portal
   calls `POST /api/connect/init`, which builds the URL from the deployed list.
2. **Hand-built URL:** same `authorize` URL as above with a real `state`
   (`base64url({customer_id, return_url, timestamp})`). The callback rejects a `state`
   older than **60 minutes** (`connect.ts`), so a staged URL is good for one hour from
   the timestamp inside it — re-stage rather than extend the window.

Scopes are additive on re-consent, so the new token carries the old grants plus the
new ones. Two things the list cannot fix:

- **Journals is tier-gated.** `accounting.journals.read` is necessary for `GET /Journals`
  but not sufficient — Xero gates the Journals endpoint behind its Advanced tier and a
  security assessment under the 2026 pricing model. A 401/403 on `/Journals` while the
  token's claim already contains the scope is the tier gate, not this list.
- **Broad scopes have a clock.** This app predates 2026-03-02, so the broad
  `accounting.transactions` and `accounting.reports.read` stay valid until September
  2027. Moving to the granular replacements is its own migration with its own re-consent.
